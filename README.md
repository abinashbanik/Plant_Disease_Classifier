# Plant_Disease_Classifier
This thesis explores the application of deep learning models for detecting plant diseases. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including CNN-128, NASNetLarge, ResNet50, and Vgg16, were evaluated on a combined dataset containing images from public sources (PlantVillage and Tea_Sickness_Dataset) and a private dataset of rubber leaf health. The CNN-128 model achieved the highest validation accuracy (92.55%) after 50 epochs of training on an RTX4050 laptop using a Jupyter Notebook environment. Additionally, a Streamlit web application was developed to allow users to upload images for disease prediction and plant type classification.
